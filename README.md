Developing an Annotation Scheme for Clinical Narratives in European Portuguese through Human Variation Analysis
This repository contains the supplementary materials for the article "Enhancing an Annotation Scheme for Clinical Narratives in European Portuguese through Human Variation Analysis." It includes annotation resources, synthetic clinical reports, and documentation related to the Text2Story-based medical domain annotation scheme.

📄 About the Project

This project explores how human variation in annotation can inform the refinement of semantic annotation schemes. It focuses on clinical narratives written in European Portuguese and proposes a domain-specific extension of the Text2Story annotation scheme tailored to medical contexts.

The process involved:

Creating a medical-domain-specific decision tree to guide semantic classification.

Conducting a pilot annotation round using synthetic clinical reports.

Analyzing annotation variation across annotators.

Revising the guidelines to enhance consistency and clarity.
